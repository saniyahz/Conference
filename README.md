About Collaborators
Saniyah : Decred stakeholder since 2017. Active voter on most proposals for new Decred projects. Was part of the Toronto 2018/2019 crypto conferences: I proactively helped organize for the conferences with the local decred community members.
“The reason I want to see decred at the conference is because the Middle East is an emerging market for crypto and it opens up regions beyond UAE, like Africa, South Asia etc... Dubai in particular is known for its conferences/exhibitions and this platform provides exposure to high net worth individuals, companies looking to collaborate and or participate in the evolution of the project. 




Overview
Dubai crypto conference is a great opportunity for decred to show its presence in the Middle East.
Reasons why decred should showcase:
-	Emerging market in a tax free jurisdiction
-	New exchanges in the region (BitOasis, Rain etc.)
-	High net worth individuals/ investors
-	Not many cryptos coming to the conference; providing decred the opportunity to lead the conversation
-	Build decred community in the region
The conference offers affordable packages for participation: I have been able to negotiate the price for the Silver Package ($15,000USD down to $11,000USD)- which includes ( 2x2 booth+20 min presentation). We also have the option to take the presentation only package ($10,000USD) for a 20 min presentation which can be done remotely. If this proposal is approved, I would like to further ask the community to suggest what the 20min presentation should be about and who can deliver it etc.
